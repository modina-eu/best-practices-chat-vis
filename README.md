# umap_tsne_embedding_visualiser

The chat visualiser distributes snippets of spoken audio from taken from a series conversational videos where the artists talked about their creative practice entitled, “Best practices chat”. A total of 860+ audio samples are mapped across a latent space that can be navigated to "remix" the conversation. Dimensionality reduction is achieved using UMAP and t-SNE embeddings, which can be compared inside the interactive demo.
